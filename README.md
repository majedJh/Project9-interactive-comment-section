## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Used my small self-built CSS library
- JS
- JS Fetch
- JSON

### What I learned

The hardest project so far, yet the most entertaining one. Learnt how to use current user data, used fetch chain, loaded comments from the json file, then implemented the interactive logic.

### Continued development

I should've divided the login into more functions for more reeuseability.
